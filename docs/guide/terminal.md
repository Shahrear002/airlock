# Terminal Features

Airlock provides a powerful terminal experience with support for multiple tabs, split panes, and advanced customization.

## Split Screen

Airlock allows you to view multiple sessions side-by-side using split panes.

### How to Split
1.  **Right-click** on any active terminal area.
2.  Select **Split Horizontal** or **Split Vertical**.
3.  A new pane will appear. You can then select a host from the sidebar to connect in this new pane.

### Resizing Panes
-   Hover over the divider between two panes.
-   Click and drag to adjust the size of the split.

## Tab Management

-   **New Tab**: Connecting to a host from the sidebar automatically creates a new tab if you are not selecting a specific split pane.
-   **Switching Tabs**: Click on the tab header to switch between different workspaces.
-   **Closing Tabs**: Click the **X** icon on the tab header to close the tab and all sessions within it.

## Context Menu Actions

Right-clicking on the terminal brings up a context menu with the following options:

-   **Copy**: Copies the selected text to your clipboard.
-   **Paste**: Pastes text from your clipboard into the terminal.
-   **Split Horizontal/Vertical**: Creates a new split pane.
-   **Close Pane**: Closes the specific terminal pane you clicked on.
