# Managing Hosts

Airlock helps you keep your connections organized with folders and search.

## Creating Folders
1.  Right-click on the sidebar background or an existing folder.
2.  Select **New Folder**.
3.  Give it a name (e.g., "Database Servers").

## Organizing Hosts
-   **Drag and Drop**: You can currently organize hosts by creating them inside folders. (Drag and Drop coming soon!)
-   **Nesting**: Folders can contain other folders, allowing for deeply nested hierarchies (e.g., `Client A > Prod > DB`).

## Editing & Deleting
-   **Edit**: Right-click any host or folder and select **Edit** to change its name or connection details.
-   **Delete**: Right-click and select **Delete**.
    > [!WARNING]
    > Deleting a folder will also permanently delete all hosts and subfolders inside it.

## Search
Use the search bar at the top of the sidebar to instantly filter your hosts. You can search by **Name** or **Hostname/IP**.
