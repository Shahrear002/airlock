# Getting Started

Welcome to Airlock! This guide will help you install and start using your new SSH client.

## Installation

### Windows
1.  Download the `.exe` (Installer) or `.msi` package from our [Releases Page](https://github.com/Shahrear002/airlock/releases/latest).
2.  Run the installer and follow the on-screen prompts.
3.  Airlock will launch automatically after installation.

### macOS
1.  Download the `.dmg` file.
2.  Open it and drag "Airlock" to your Applications folder.

### Linux
We provide `.deb`, `.rpm`, and `.AppImage` formats. Choose the one that matches your distribution.

## First Launch
When you open Airlock for the first time, it will generate a secure **Master Encryption Key**. This key is used to encrypt all your saved passwords.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This key is stored securely on your device. We do not have access to it, and it never leaves your computer.

## Your First Connection
1.  Click the **+ New Host** button in the sidebar (or right-click a folder).
2.  Enter a **Name** (e.g., "Production Server").
3.  Enter the **Hostname/IP** and **Port** (default 22).
4.  Enter your **Username** and **Password**.
5.  Click **Save**.
6.  Double-click the new host in the sidebar to connect!
